Then, the execution process of the SDIGA algorithm will be described, including the necessary steps to consider. Finally, the results obtained from the application of this algorithm will be presented, highlighting the information obtained in the output file and the one that can be accessed through the model properties."

    "The SDIGA algorithm is a subgroup discovery algorithm that uses a genetic algorithm to discover subgroups in a dataset; the genetic algorithm will run for a specified number of generations. The algorithm will find subgroups until the stopping criteria are met, which can be not enough quality of the subgroups or discovering subgrups that have already been found. It is designed to find interesting subgroups that are statistically significant and have a high predictive power."
