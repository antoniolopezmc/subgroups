Then, the execution process of the SDMap* algorithm will be described, including the necessary steps to consider. Finally, the results obtained from the application of this algorithm will be presented, highlighting the information obtained in the output file and the one that can be accessed through the model properties."

    "SDMap* [[1]](#1) is a subgroup discovery algorithm that modifies the original design of SDMap to add some pruning techniques that improve performance. These changes are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A list of best subgroups is used to prune patterns whose optimistic estimate is worse than the quality of the worst subgroup in the list.\n",
    "- In each call to FpTree where the tree does not have a single path, selectors are sorted so that those with a better optimistic estimate are processed first.\n",
    "- Each new pattern generated after this sorting is checked so that its optimistic estimate is better than the quality of the worst subgroup in the list of best subgroups. If it is not, the pattern is discarded.\n",
    "- In the construction of conditional FpTrees, branches whose optimistic estimate is worse than the quality of the worst subgroup in the list of best subgroups are discarded."
