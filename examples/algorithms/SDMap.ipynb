Then, the execution process of the SDMap algorithm will be described, including the necessary steps to consider. Finally, the results obtained from the application of this algorithm will be presented, highlighting the information obtained in the output file and the one that can be accessed through the model properties."

This algorithm uses the FPTree data structure in order to represent the complete dataset and to mine subgroups in two steps; a complete FPTree is first built from the input dataset, after which successive conditional FPTrees are built recursively in order to mine the subgroups."
